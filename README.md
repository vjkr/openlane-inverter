Magic tool is not installation,
referring Nickson Jose repsotory for fixes https://github.com/vjkr/openlane_build_script
redirecting to Kunal Ghosh repository https://github.com/kunalg123/vsdflow.git for vsdflow. Hoping the workshop i attended AdvancedPhysicalDesign workshop will be beneficial now

# :)
Seems there was an easier way for installing tools using VSDFLOW. Now 2 versions of installations are in progress.
Lets check the shortcomings in either of them referring to YouTube resources. As workshop videos arent freely available.
# Completed VSDFLOW installation- Update though success message is displayed. qflow didnt get installed. There are errors in the terminal window saying disk full. Checking storage shows storage is almost full. 20GB is not Enough!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I will delete whole VSDFLOW FOLDER as it is hampering smooth operation of VM.
Hoping to learn sky130 using youtube resources
